					Agricoltura is a framework designed to operate automated greenhouses.
					Ours are provided with a range of sensors and actuators to check, log and control their own protected environment.
					The user can either directly control them or completely rely on the system.
					Both safety and security are guaranteed within Agricoltura.

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					Agricoltura was born as a bachelors degree's final project, specifically in Computer Science and Engineering.
					It's set in a context of rapid technologic innovation in the agriculture sector, 
					which the commissioning company thought it was worth investing in.						
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea was experimenting on the model of precision agriculture. 
					A technique that relies on constant readings about environmental parameters to decide where, how and when to operate.
